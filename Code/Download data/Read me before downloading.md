# Read Me before Downloading

1. We use API call to download the data from checkbook NYC. [Read the API call syntax here](https://www.checkbooknyc.com/data-feeds/api) ; 
2. API calls will retrieve up to a maximum of 20,000 records per call. In our R script, we have pushed the limit to 60,000 records per call which should be enough for normal retrieval.
